Its a shame its now being investigated by the UK serious fraud squad against the new online laws that make social media companies responsible or face a Â£40M fine......Enjoy the fine Facebook, you deserve it for allowing scammers to grow and continue.",2023-11-12T17:26:52.000Z,1
1,"FB Marketplace a scammers paradise.I'd say more than half of the adds are scams in Marketplace.  Many have clearly created fake profiles, use google stock images as their pictures, fake jobs and history.    I did try and flag a particular seller to FB and an automated response (Probably some AI nonsense) said that it was genuine despite the individual not existing, fake profile pics, fake job, fake location etc  etc.    BUYERS BEWARE",2023-11-10T17:31:57.000Z,1
2,Absolutely rubbish they encourage you to report bullying you do then your acc gets restricted I would avoid Facebook at all costs. I have sent proof to them I hadn't done anything wrong if they bothered to read the message properly they would see who the bully is. I would how ever like to ask how can someone bully themselves. This isn't the first time they've done this. Face book can I ask someone telling me to get run over and die how is that not bullying this was the lame excuse you used when I reported it. Read the messages properly you will see who the person was that actually wrote that. You appeal nothing gets done. You lot at Facebook are as bad as the trolls and bullies I will be taking this further. Facebook is certainly not safe. But I guess money = stupidity,2023-11-11T10:29:43.000Z,1
3,"1 star is too generous. My Facebook account active since 2007 was hacked and Facebook have disabled my account stating I am not eligible to use Facebook and the decision is final. Their support pages take you around the houses in this case and when you try to complete the claim form to appeal the decision it wonâ??t send.  Facebook support also donâ??t even have the courtesy to reply to emails. I do not feel it is fair or justified that I am the victim here yet treated like itâ??s my fault. Iâ??m so upset Iâ??ve lost friends & family connections, memories and photos plus music connections I had on my profile and the fact Facebook are holding my account and can wipe all this when they choose is just heartbreaking. I really feel for anybody who is in this same boat but hey what can we do? Nothing and itâ??s not for the lack of trying to engage with Facebook to resolve it. :-(",2023-11-12T00:07:17.000Z,1

I did have mobile set up but apparently they donâ??t recognise that either. Then sent my passport details, and still a problem. They confirmed it was me, sent a password to log back in, and then still say the account does not confirm with their standards! Facebook is a farce. I have been using  them for 17 years and now this! Itâ??s a joke! I suppose the only good thing I was going on there to much, so now it has force stopped me to use them again, so good riddance!",2023-11-11T10:30:33.000Z,1

I enter the code then I am presented with another screen prompting me to enter my authentication code that was set up using two factor authentication. Well I never set this up so the person who hacked my account may have, I have tried everything to get back in but cannot. My only option according to Facebook to prove who I am is to send them ID like a drivers license, passport, voter registration card, etc. Are you kidding me ? Who in Gods name would send this info to them? Where the heck would it end up and how might this info be used for nefarious reasons! I want to know why the person who hacked my account didnâ??t have to provide ID. How ironic is that.",2023-11-09T16:39:42.000Z,1

11,"Sick and fed up of Facebook. Easily two thirds of my feed is adverts. Thereâ??s a limit to the number of adverts you can report in a day, but this comes nowhere near the number of adverts you actually get. Fairâ??s fair, Facebook - if I can only report 20 ads a day, then you should only show me 20 ads. And furthermore, you should actually check whatâ??s being reported instead of sending an automatic message saying all your (paid, obviously) ads meet your (not very) stringent requirements. They donâ??t. La Poste, for example, does not sell off pallets of undelivered parcels for â?¬2, yet you think this scam is ok!",2023-11-06T20:26:52.000Z,1
12,"Facebook, has pushed interactions beyond all else good or bad. They constantly recommend me pages sharing blatant lies that exist only to get like.

Now it tries to be everything, tries to be instagram and tries to be whatsapp. We dont even like you, stop getting involved in applications we been using for years and buying them getting us to have to use facebook. Why did u buy whatsapp? I dont want facebook anything to do with my whatsapp. And i stopped using facebook since they slyly took everyones facial scans and uploaded them to make a facial recognition programme. One day i will sue them for this as they had no right to do this without permission. Its also funny how they disabled it and said all templates have now been deleted. Obviously it came on top and they had to pull out. Someone tell me any of this is fake or that i am lying.

18,Facebook used to be a great site to build your business or fanpages. Now it is a Disaster. For a 3 day Campaign Facebook (Recommends) $18.00With the places I have set it would give me 2.6K - 7.5K Reach. Of those views I have seen Ads get OVER 11K Reactions. Thing is YOU get shadowbanned for scrolling or liking too much. IF you pay for a feature like INVITING those engaged YET Facebook prevents you from doing that. You are being robbed of using all of your potential reach. Facebook needs to realize IF you pay for the likes you should also be allowed to invite the likes PERIOD.,2023-11-05T19:48:29.000Z,1

However, I encountered an issue when I received a notification that my Facebook ads account had been disabled and blocked. I promptly submitted a support ticket, and after a period of waiting, I received a response stating that there was no wrongdoing on my part, and my account had been wrongfully blocked. They assured me that I could resume using ads.However, despite resolving the issue with my ads account, the block on my Facebook page remains in place. To make matters worse, the 100 euros I had allocated for advertising have disappeared from my account, leaving me unable to use them for their intended purpose. I've been making efforts to contact Facebook for further assistance, but unfortunately, there is no live chat option available, not even through Facebook itself. My only option seems to be submitting another support ticket and patiently awaiting a response.I'm currently at a loss as to what steps to take next, and I'm eagerly looking for a solution to this frustrating situation.if they contact me thru chat so we  can resolve this issue i would appreciate.they can find me on the page name Creativity webdesign",2023-11-09T16:18:29.000Z,1

To put out  unchallenged statement's  and create a comment section that is no more than an echo chamber of the clubâ??s Pat on its own back .  So comments sections on Facebook are rendered pointless and often boring. Because not only do the pages administrators have the  free rein to hide comments, virtually delete them and create a public reaction to suit their own dogma. Fake book works hand in hand with them to  facilitate, their censorship. The Thought Police have never had it so good. As they do in 2023. This applies across all media and even those irritating reaction videos. If institutions and others canâ??t handle critical and thoughtful comment then they should be driven of social media. Other than that Facebook should just get back to being an actual social networking site . Rather than a free platform for the power wielders to put out unchallengeable statements.

Here's a balanced review of Facebook, taking into account both its positive and negative aspects:Positive Aspects:Connectivity: Facebook has connected billions of people worldwide, allowing them to stay in touch with friends and family, regardless of geographical barriers. It has played a pivotal role in maintaining and nurturing relationships.Information Sharing: Facebook provides a platform for sharing news, information, and personal experiences. It has helped raise awareness about social issues, events, and emergencies.Business Opportunities: For businesses, Facebook is a powerful advertising and marketing platform.

This can be a valuable resource for people seeking support, advice, or networking opportunities.Events and Fundraising: Facebook Events feature allows users to create and promote events, and its fundraising tools have been used for various charitable causes.Negative Aspects:Privacy Concerns: Facebook has faced numerous privacy controversies over the years, including data breaches and concerns about the misuse of user data.

However, it is not without its share of controversies and negative consequences, including privacy concerns, mental health issues, and the spread of misinformation.

I did my research, as my gut feeling was that it was a scam, and as I suspected it was a scam.  Apparently they would ultimately ask me for my personal details, including bank details.

310,"1 star is far too complementary for this criminal enterprise. I had an account with FB for 8 years or more. I never signed up for their app as I've said in other reviews these social media/government controlled conglomerate's have no right to all the files on my devices which is what they make you agree to when you join their app. I don't have anything good to say about F(word)Book other than it gave me an opportunity to converse with many old and distant friends and Marketplace was by far the best thing they offered. I never, not one time posted anything on a public forum and I only posted and commented to my or friends threads.Their true colors were exposed when they began censoring 1st amendment protected free speech and if a post went against their Marxist agenda they would suspend you. I was suspended many times though everything that I posted was true and could be backed up with evidence but that didn't matter to FB because they had a communist agenda to stop speech that exposed the corruption in the democrat party, the medical community/big pharma and their illegal and evil agenda with the plandemic, the severely criminally compromised election system, Hunter Bidens laptop that has more incriminating information on it than any evidence in history! For whatever reason I was suspended for 30 days and told I had 30 days to file a rebuttal. I waited and filed within 30 days but I never was given an opportunity to defend myself or my opinions? They only gave me multiple choice responses that didn't represent my predicament at all! Then they had the damn nerve to tell me, ""since you didn't respond, we cancelled your account! The whole process was criminal and authoritarian and as far as I'm concerned those that censored and canceled me should be behind bars which is far more civil than what I want to do to them for stealing my intellectual property and severing ties with friends that I have yet to restore over 3 years later.  The whole cancellation process was complete BS and aside from heads rolling there is nothing they can do to make it up to me. Suckerburg is a coward and his fact checkers are as well, they all need to be held accountable for their unethical and illegal actions and I can't say what I want done to him and expect this review to be posted. I hope our government holds them accountable but that's not likely going to happen when our government is more corrupt than F(word)book is!

How difficult can that be for them to do? The reply I got was: Â«Â Â«Â Â«Â We have looked into your request and decided that the profile doesnâ??t go against community standardsÂ Â»The issue is so simple to address. First understand that the profile is fake and remove it. Obviously I cannot remove or delete the profile because I donâ??t have that option. The reason I donâ??t have that option to delete it is that it wasnâ??t me who set it up.One of Metaâ??s Community Standards is copied below: Account integrity and authentic identityPolicy rationaleAuthenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps create a community where people are accountable to each other, and to Facebook, in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the range of diverse ways that identity is expressed across our global community, while also preventing impersonation and identity misrepresentation. That is why we require people to connect on Facebook using the name they go by in everyday life. Our Authenticity Policies are intended to create a safe environment where people can trust and hold one another accountable.In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove accounts that are harmful to the community, including those that compromise the security of other accounts and our services. We have built a combination of automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to persistently or egregiously abuse our Community Standards.Because account level removal is a severe action, whenever possible, we aim to give our community a chance to learn our rules and follow our Community Standards. Penalties, including account disables, are designed to be proportionate to the severity of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe safety risks, will lead to an account being disabled.",2023-08-22T14:34:00.000Z,1

Normally you can spot them by their advertised spam about god etc and how someone helped them with their debt with a whats-app link. After reporting 1,000's of these over the past year, Facebook has failed to remove them under their report function. They never remove terrorist videos from their site. even after reporting them.

375,Facebook is an extremely biased company removing any messages they don't deem worthy of their app. They like blocking random people for the fun of it. I have been blocked from sharing coupons in a coupon sharing group. I have Been blocked for reporting a scammer in marketplace and luckily that's it. But Facebook is not with it. Even marketplace is a scam. I'll go on my account and find like 5 motor bikes for sale and go into another account and find 20 for sale with the same filters. So all in all Facebook sucks.,2023-08-17T22:01:09.000Z,1

390,"On 1st July this year, an acquaintance of mine contacted me to ask for help in getting back into his account, as his new phone had locked him out. I initially told him I didn't want to help, as he was not even living in the same country as me. However, 30 minutes later he started trying to ring me, insisting I was a trusted friend. I was busy and didn't really want to be distracted at that point, and wanted just to get him out of my hair and as he had once claimed to have difficulties with such things I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and sent him the code he asked for. It was a fatal mistake. The next day I realised what he had done. But there was no help forthcoming, after following their protocols in the case of being hacked, and sending a copy of my passport. No one got back to me. The only people who did were friends warning me that they were now getting funny messages about having won money and that they should click dodgy links. He was also writing inappropriate posts on my group pages. In fact the hacker was even pestering people by ringing them!!! My phone number was changed, and one of my emails replaced by his.Four months on I was asked to verify a password code several times on the threat of having this account suspended, but it seems the hackers got away with it again, and are still using and abusing my old account, harassing other people in my name. 15 years of photos and memories alongside my art pages are still down the drain, this despite my having written emails several times, even having sent a registered letter to the FB headquarters asking that the account be deleted, despite several friends also flagging my old account as hacked. By the second week I had created a second account, because I did not want to lose my friends and the people I had following me on my art pages. Most of my old friends seemed fine about it, but one or two others were suspicious: an old teacher just wrote a terse note to say she could not be sure if I was not the hacker. When I reached out to one friend whom I heard had been inquiring about what had happened, he started asking me intrusive personal questions about my marital status and non-existent children, taunted me on one of my posts, and later on, still made it clear he thought I was a clone. His unpleasant attitude almost trumped being hoodwinked by the hacker. More to the point, as an interesting coincidence, just as the final clone accusation came in, Facebook pulled the plug, and I was told I was locked out of this account. There since followed fruitless weeks of trying to get back in, being promised I could get in after sending my ID, which is sensitive information, countless times, only to be sent straight back to the 'we have locked your account' page. So what a superbly kafkaesque topsy-turvy world it is! Cyber criminals and spammers keep getting away with It, and bona fide users who don't harass the community get punished instead. Facebook has the monopoly currently, and there are people I know who use only this platform. I need it to stay in touch with these people, and to do certain kinds of business. No other social media site comes near in its user-friendly interface and sheer volume of users. However, I would be delighted to put behind the humiliation and sense of violation, alongside the loss of faith and integrity in the eyes of others in a shot, if I thought there was an alternative to Facebook that did have inbuilt customer service protections that actually worked, regardless of whether you are premium. That, beyond any privacy issues. This lack of support for users who get hacked speaks volumes about the contempt with which users seem to be held. No doubt, if ever market share starts to drop once complaints like mine continue to rise, this might even change with or without business or paid subscriptions. But after all, Facebook profess to take fraud and community standards very seriously, don't they. Why does that somehow reek of hypocrisy right now. There are countless stories like mine, some from people who have lost money due to hackers, sometimes in the Tens of thousands (I always thought adding a bank account to FB was too risky). Others get may find themselves banned due to the hacker posting the kind of photos guaranteed to really smear someone. For me, the biggest loss was the loss of faith from among individuals whom I had hoped would be able to tell the difference between my voice and that of the hacker, where in one case not even a handwritten message from my actual address did anything to dispel the overall paranoia. Existentially, not just Kafka, but Phillip K Dick territory. Either way there are complaints everywhere I look and, not just here, where a whopping 72% have given Facebook a one.",2023-10-30T18:44:54.000Z,1

398,"Avoid the Eatontown NJ Pep boys location at all costs!!! I had an appointment scheduled to have brakes and tires done at 12 PM. I was told the car would be finished by 4 PM. By 5 PM the car was not finished and I heard the Store Manager on the phone and it was apparent they did NOT have the parts needed to repair my car, even though the mechanic had pulled my car brakes apart and was waiting to do the repair. While sitting in their waiting room only 15 feet away, I overheard the store manager Joe tell an employee to CALL me and tell me and tell me my car would not be done that day. I had already been there over 5 hours at this point. The employee pointed over to me and told the Manager Joe that I had been sitting there for over 5 hours. THE MANAGER THEN PROCEDED TO LEAVE FOR THE DAY! This left me without a driveable car And myself, the store employee and mechanic not knowing what to do. The entire day I had asked for a detailed invoice regarding the work to be done and the costs. I was continually given excuses why they couldn't give me this to me until the work was done. I was told by Joe the Manager that they were cheaper than a dealership which was NOT true and were actually more expensive! I didn't leave the location until 6 and a half hours later. I was forced to leave with a car that had to have to it's old worn out brakes put back on it in order for me to drive home. I was NEVER TOLD at any time until 5 hours later that there was any problems or that they didnt have or couldn't get the parts needed to do the brakes on my car. I was forced to go to another location to have my brakes repaired. I was also lied to that tires I had purchased from them were eligible for a 100 dollars rebate. This was NOT True. Upon contacting Joe the store manager again, he was not only rude but refused to do anything to rectify the situation.  If you want the worst car repair experience possible then go to this location.

505,"Facebook or Meta is one of those companies that have grown to become ""too big to fail"", so they behave as they like and it comes at a cost to their users. Unfortunately, they also know that people use their platform out of necessity, as they have such a big crowd on their platform. As they've become so big, they also have to automate allot of what they do, taking out the personal aspect of what is needed. For example, when reporting spamming, fake pages or what ever that goes bump in the night for the users of Meta, they tend to automate that part of the process and report back with that infamous ""[...]We've taken a look and found that this content doesn't go against our Community Standards[...]"", when clearly there is a problem that needs to be handled and in some cases, can be very dangerous and costly for the users if the scam or what ever the problem is is not handled and the user falls for it. This is also incredible dangerous for warding off fake news or false information as no one can report it as such, you'll always get ignored by them (or 99.9% of the time) and the dangerous and toxic content gets to poison their users for longer than it should be.Meta has also been fined multiple times for mishandling of user information, especially from the EU as they have been caught transporting user info to the US which allows the US government to access the user information as they are required by the US government to hand over all user data as a part of a supposedly national security. If you need any proof of this, simply Duckduckgo for it and you'll get everything you need.I could go on but the bottom line is, if I could, I would most definitionally ditch Facebook as it's toxic and dangerous, but as I stated above, it's a necessity for many so for me it's a necessary evil, or at least until another more wholesome alternative will be offered.",2023-07-19T15:01:35.000Z,1

The Hacker now has access to 20 years of my personal messages to friends and family. No email address that answers?  No customer service phone number?  I even contacted Meta through Oculus - they told me that they cannot contact Facebook to forward my issue to the correct department! Insanity. Mr Zuckerburg, Meta is a disgrace: obviously being hauled in front of the US Congress and refusing a request to appear before the UK DCMS Committee means nothing to you, or your profit margins.FYI you can find my hacked profile at fb/pete.richardson.92(last number redacted) - my picture persists, yet the hacker has removed any reset options apart from their own hacked Hotmail email.The Hacker also disconnected my Instagram account with the same ID, which I still have access to!  Having submitted a picture of myself holding my valid UK passport with matching picture to both FB and Instagram accounts, I got this automated message back:""Hi,We canâ??t give you access to this account or continue with your request because we havenâ??t received an acceptable ID that matches the information listed on the account.

Nothing happened so a couple of days later when back from holiday I tried again. It said press the button. It cited a comment I had made about child exploitation or something. Of course I had made no such comment. The review button did absolutely nothing, no one contacted me to discuss what had happened and the time to them closing my account was approaching.

571,"I recently had the pleasure of using Facebook, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in numerous ways. As someone who mainly used other social media platforms before, I am genuinely impressed with the features and opportunities that Facebook provides.Firstly, the user interface is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive. Navigating through the various sections of Facebook, such as the news feed, messenger, and marketplace, was a breeze. Additionally, the layout is clean and visually appealing, making it easy to find and engage with content.One of the standout features for me is the news feed. It provides a comprehensive and personalized overview of updates from friends, family, and pages I follow. Facebook's algorithm seems to have a good handle on my interests, as I consistently come across interesting and relevant posts. Additionally, the option to customize my news feed preferences ensures that I see the content that matters most to me.Another aspect that impressed me is the level of connectivity Facebook offers. It's effortless to find and connect with friends, both old and new. The platform provides various tools to interact with other users, such as liking, commenting, and sharing posts, as well as messaging and video calling. These features make it easy to stay connected with loved ones, regardless of distance or time zones.Facebook also stands out with its marketplace feature. It allows users to buy and sell items locally. I have found this to be a convenient and reliable way to purchase second-hand goods or find unique items within my community. The ability to ask questions, view seller profiles, and read reviews from other buyers ensures a safe and secure marketplace experience.Lastly, I appreciate the privacy settings and control Facebook gives its users. The platform allows for customizing privacy settings for posts, photos, and personal information. This attention to privacy and security makes me feel more confident and at ease when using Facebook.Overall, I highly recommend Facebook to anyone seeking a versatile and user-friendly social media platform. Its vast array of features, easy navigation, and emphasis on privacy make it an excellent choice for those looking to connect with friends, discover new content, and engage with their community.

It has evolved over the years, constantly adapting and offering new features that keep millions of users engaged and connected.

Recently, my account was suspended without any valid reason or prior notification, which has caused significant disruptions to my work and daily activities. As a dedicated user who has always followed Facebook's guidelines, I was shocked to discover that my account had been deactivated without any explanation.The impact of this suspension has been far-reaching, particularly in relation to my work. I heavily rely on my Facebook login to access interconnected websites that are integral to my professional endeavors. The suspension has denied me access to critical files, photos, and designs that are essential tools for my work. Consequently, my productivity has suffered immensely, hindering my ability to meet professional responsibilities and commitments.Despite reaching out to Facebook's support team and requesting an urgent reactivation of my account, the process has been frustratingly slow and unresponsive. It is disheartening to be met with silence and a lack of assistance in resolving this matter promptly. I have not violated any of the platform's terms of use, making the suspension all the more perplexing and unjustified.I implore Facebook to address this issue with urgency and reinstate my account without further delay. The unwarranted suspension has caused unnecessary distress and inconvenience. As a devoted user, I expected better support and resolution from Facebook.

PURE GREED!Facebook will prevent you from listing images of say a sports bra or leggings that show a little bit of stomach because, you know, they say it is too sexual. Well, they allow some to advertise such things, so they pick and choose - lack of consistency and fairness. They even block image that show the product only - no skin, no person wearing the product. Try getting a staff member to help - nope, not gonna happen.Facebook ads are overpriced.Facebooks ads often mess up.Facebook should invest the money they suck from honest people, and put it into blogging fake accounts, scams etc.Facebook has a serious lack of support - try getting a human to answer your question.

I reported the chat log as â??hackedâ?? to facebook with no response. My mother has gone through all suggested steps in the help center. Nothing works because the hacker gained access to her account and changed the email address and phone number and logged her out of all devices extremely quickly.We are already dealing with SO MUCH with my sister being missing in Washington State, and now we are being terrorized while Facebook allows it to happen. My momâ??s account is facebook deneen.raptor (links not allowed)She is disabled, and Facebook was her connection to the world, and all her friends and family. Our family uses the name Raptor for spiritual reasons and we are known to our loved ones, friends and neighbors as the â??Raptorâ? family. Her ID will show her legal first name and legal date of birth. She has been using this account for many years in Colorado. It should be obvious to Facebook that her account was hacked by looking at the historical activity prior to the last email update and it should be restored to the control of my momâ??s original email address that she started the account with. Their ""security"" is a joke. I have screenshots from the scammer asking for $80 to return control of her account to her, but she doesn't have the money and neither do I and facebook shouldn't let disabled people be extorted and terrorized.",2023-05-11T15:49:45.000Z,1

Iâ??m supposed to be able to verify my identity to get back it. On both mobile and laptop, I get an error: system error on desktop; blank screen on mobile. Facebookâ??s Cracker Jack box of IT support has told me at least 5 times to go through the verification steps and choose â??a different way to identify myselfâ? on a â??device Iâ??ve used in the pastâ?. Iâ??ve had my cell phone for at least three years. Apparently thatâ??s not a long enough time to be a recognized device.

835,"Facebook proves that America is collapsing. You can't fight against America's fascist propaganda without getting your Facebook account censored or worse... banned. More countries are allying with each other to fight against America's fascism. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But Facebook's censorship is part of why World War 3 becomes inevitable when wealthy tyrants tell users what they can post on social media. Facebook is part of the brainwashing agenda to create sheeple who are datamined for profit rather than critical thinkers who question social media authorities. Facebook also represents late stage capitalism where people are psychologically harassed for profit without harassers being sent to prison.High school kids are getting groomed by sickos on Facebook who groom and kidnap. Those sickos are not getting banned while journalists exposing American war crimes get shadowbanned on Facebook. It shows the vile and disgusting people controlling Facebook who should be sent to prison for allowing groomers unbanned while shadowbanning journalists exposing America's fascist propaganda. It's why some parents don't let their high school kids go on Facebook to avoid them getting groomed and kidnapped. I'm not a parent. But I would never let a kid be on social media until they were 18. These social media platforms are controlled by wealthy predators who promote datamining and propaganda to turn children into vulnerable consumers of predatory business owners that don't care about ethics. It's a perfect environment for greedy and sadistic sociopaths who prey on children.Also, I want to let people know Facebook's way of showing comments is bulllying. ""Relevant comments"" is high school bully mentality. Other people's comments get buried, so you have to click on ""all comments"". But even then, you would waste needless time looking for their ""irrelevant"" comments after clicking on ""all comments"". Facebook is determined to keep people from having decent conversations with this malicious ""relevant comments"" nonsense. Also, Facebook won't give you the ""oldest comments"" option. It's never about practicality when trying to look for very old comments on Facebook quickly. This is why Facebook's comment system is impractical and wastes people's time. It's also a way to make people feel bad when their comments are buried without clicking ""all comments"". This is not helping people's self-esteem and mental health at all. I would consider Facebook to be a malicious platform determined to harass users for profit.There are genuinely friendly platforms that allow users to have more than 5,000 friends. But on Facebook, you can only have 5,000 friends or less. Facebook is not that friendly.Also, you cannot post statuses and react to people's posts nonstop. Facebook's system will eventually say your nonstop reactions and statuses violate its Community Standards. Community Standards that are full of crap. I don't deal with this nonsense on Discord. On Discord, you can react to people's messages and make posts nonstop without Discord's system preventing that from happening. It just shows how boring Facebook is.",2023-04-14T14:20:45.000Z,1

HERE WE GO 34 E-mail contacts with their security and they sent me 9 codes all of which didn't work so after 3 days of this BS from them decided the aggravation wasn't worth the FaceBook BS seems form what I heard they at the security level have no  idea what the hell they are doing and leave the customer out in the cold so if this is their idea of help it sucks so bad I am on longer interested I found other ways free to communicate with family back home bye FACEBOOK,2023-04-01T11:57:23.000Z,1

839,"I really don't like how Facebook has access to us even when we're not using the app. I just re-read the agreement because I thought it was weird whenever my man & I talked about something & it would show up on my feed once I would open the ap again. It would be the 1st thing I'd see to I didn't realize I agreed to them to be able to listen to us & detect voices in my house or anything for that matter. I have a small child. So that means they are listening to him. That honestly scares me. Why are you listening to us in privacy? That's not what the terms and conditions say. I also didn't realize that they can detect my location whenever. That means they know exactly what school my son goes to. My family don't even know that information. Hackers can break into anything & trafficking is so bad now days and this gives them all the information they need. Facebook also has access to all the photos in my phone & email as I read to. I don't show alot of my son's pictures on fb because of trafficking and now I really don't feel safe at all. Because my photos are backed to my email. Which Facebook can access any time they want. I'm not a conspiracy theorist at all but I looked it up and trafficking has gone up since the time we had to agree to NEW terms. Like no lie, that's creepy and makes me wonder how deep this goes. Also another thing teenagers use this app. And I was a teenager once as girls we take sexy pictures & we wouldn't even send them to people. We just want cute pictures. Those pictures get saved to your phone which means they get saved to Facebooks data in their network and God knows who has access to these photos. Like I'm not trying to he funny, but parents catch their daughters all the time doing this stuff and the parent goes off on them telling them the dangers now this makes it even more dangerous! Have you noticed the up rise in human trafficking? It can't be because of nothing. These people have to know what woman and girls or boys to go after and when to go after them. Most teenagers and mostly teenage girls are snatched up when they are alone. Facebook is the only app that can detect when their are other voices around where exactly we are and when. Like I'm just putting all of this together and it honestly makes all kinds of sense. I think this is bigger than what we think it is. It's not just a tiktoker on a vendetta but a woman worried about other woman and children. Especially our little girls. Remember protect the children? It's time we protect them and completely remove this app and any other app like Instagram and Twitter. I don't know about Twitter cause I never get on mine and their terns aren't the same. But Instagram is and more teenagers use insta than any other app. Please if you have children remove these apps. We need to find out what's really going on. I know I'm probably gonna get some backlash saying I'm crazy but I'd rather be crazy than stupid. Look at the terms and conditions on Facebook they have access to EVERYTHING on your phone including photos. videos. emails and everything in your emails, g mail has a bunch of stuff including photos videos, it only uses ur location when ur using maps (so Remember when i said fb has access to all of your apps? MAPS is considered an app also btw)... let that sink in. contacts exc. I can't remember the rest. But the more you think about it the scarier it gets. Like really look into what I'm saying and you'll realize that I'm not that far off. Also my phone number isn't saved on Facebook. How do they know all of my contacts in my phone including my doctors cause I see them all the time in suggested friends including people I may know that are mutual with my friends that don't even have Facebook. You know how you see people all the time in the people you may know thar you actually have no idea who they are? That's because a friend/family/dr/teacher/exc knows them even if they don't have a Facebook. And like I said my phone number isn't connected to Facebook so how would they know all of that? Because like I said they have complete access to your phone. Another thing I have a friend that a man that facetimed her young daughters phone and he was playing with himself. It's not a friend in real life but I'm not gonna say where I saw it.  Her daughter phones screen videos whenever she gets a face time cause she's 12. And don't ask why a 12 yr old has a phone it's no one's business. Alot of younger kids have phones and like I said and are on these 2 apps. Now Remember everything I said. Add it up let it sink in for a minute and even fact check me. Cause I'm not wrong. I'm not paranoid. I'm not crazy. I'm critical. And we need to put a stop to this and honestly need to figure out what they really are doing with our stuff.",2023-04-01T03:48:29.000Z,1

852,"I once had a Facebook account many years ago and then decided to delete my account, because of their political ideologies, and went through the various stages to have all account data deleted on Facebook.A year ago or saw I decided to renew my Facebook account to check on one person's status only and went through the ID step to get my account activated again after being deleted several years ago.Well, some time later out of the blue, Facebook said my account will be banned for going against Facebook's rules. Mind you I had deleted my account several years ago. I haven't written or have access to anything since my Facebook account was deleted. So I tried again to activate my deleted Facebook account and again later on I get the same threat that my Facebook account will be banned permanently due to going against Facebook rules. That I had something like a certain amount of days to appeal the decision.LoL, No way to contact Facebook to find out what rule I broke to be banned since I haven't written or used Facebook since I deleted my account several years ago.But thankful that Facebook was so biased towards me because now I don't need to use Facebook anymore since the person I was interested in I was able to get the status using another Social Media.As far as I am concern they can permanently ban me for whatever unknown false allegations they have against me after I deleted my Facebook account several years ago.Thus the one star rating.

That is them trying to hack my Google account.There is no way to complain to Facebook about it there's nothing Facebook is going to do to take these scammers off of there in my opinion Facebook is nothing but a cesspool nowadays and I am off of there for good!,2023-03-16T01:46:13.000Z,1
942,"Facebook Support is gonna drive me to drink!  I have a personal page and 2 community pages, and a group page. I've had these for years.  I use FB pay for sending my adult kids $$ when they need a little.  Almost 3 days ago.  I got a notification that 1 of my community pages had been restricted.   While one of the other admins & I were trying to figure out what happened, my entire account was locked. So now, I'm trying to figure out why my account is locked and can only find out that a post on my page violated standards of FB community by way of a posting by dangerous organizations.  So I follow prompts unlock my account by clicking ""get started"" button.  I type my email to get a verification code.  Once I have the code, I follow instructions to prove my identity by sending a photo of my ID.  I go to my email acct. To retrieve the temporary acct verification code to recover my account.   I click the ""recover account "" button in the email that has the verification code, per instructions and.....nothing! I'm still getting the screen saying my account is locked.  At the bottom of the screen is a button saying ""continue"". I click it and nothing.  So I page back and click on Facebook Support chat.  I describe the issue and I'm sent a scripted auto response that says (among other things) that if I use an email that is associated with Facebook or Instagram my account will not be unlocked.  By this time, I've tried using my Yahoo and my Google email accounts, so I try again with my hubby's email because I have only 2 email accounts and 1 is used with my personal FB & IG pages, the other is used for my community pages.  Also, while this is going on, I'm now getting a notification from my Google account that someone is trying to access my account from a server in Tunisia.  I report it.  At the same time, I'm getting emails that say my pages are being restricted due to unusual activity from FB.  I'm also getting emails from FB, that someone is purchasing ads on my community pages....and FB is approving these ads and charging me.  So, I'm going back and forth with Facebook Support making more attempts to recover my account.  I'm having to restate the problem over and over again for each Support person I get. They keep closing my Support chat prematurely and before checking to see if the issue is resolved.  They keep referring me back to the ""get started"" button and procedure....which I attempt 4 more times.  They then give me a link to FB help desk, which I can't access because my account is blocked. 1st my email accounts weren't good, then my hubby's email was no good because it's being used from an unfamiliar device .  Then it's because I'm still signed in on my FB & IG accounts.  But they don't tell me how to log out of them when I can't access my account. So I search around the FB Support chat menu and figure out how to logout of everything...and try the process again.  Now the pictures of my ID aren't clear enough.  So I retake them 4 more times to get to one they approve and still no go.  I click on chat again and there's no agent available and over an hour wait.  The only good news, is I get an email notification that the ads are being suspended because if unusual activity. Yay!  So this is being going on for 2 days now.  I try FB Support chat 2 more times, keep getting the same scripted auto responses about unusual activity violating community standards, using an email account not associated with FB/IG.  I repeat everything about knowing my account was hacked. Chats keep auto closing because, apparently I can't type 2 days worth of chat info. fast enough.....even though their auto responses tell me they have access to prior conversations.  It's now day 3,  and FB has released the ads the hacker purchased and is charging me double the amount.  I cancel my credit/debit card, change my Google password, I change my security settings on  my phone.  Now, when I click ""get sarted"" I never get sent any codes, I can't get into my accts, and I can't access Support chat.  I somehow get a log in screen that allows me to reset my password so I can try to access help desk again.  No go, still locked.  I click Support chat go through everything all over again with the same scripted responses same questions that have been asked and answered over 6 times, referred back to ""get started"" and help desk.  Create a new email account to use for confirmation security code.  I get no response.  They send an email to my hubby's email asking him to confirm that his is the last email account added to FB and he unwittingly clicks confirm and now I can't get any responses at all from Support.  I am an admin/editor on 2 pages and 1 group that are operated by non-profits.  There are so many people that I have no other way of keeping in touch with, and FB is the main social media I use for my special needs advocacy.  I'm furious ð??¤.",2023-03-16T00:15:41.000Z,1

955,"Facebook should be brought to justice..The amount of sponsored ads on there which are obvious scams (to anyone with half a brain) is getting ridiculous. Mainly Chinese and Indian scam gangs, numerous ads under different website names, all obviously the same gangs. PS5's for Â£150,Ice machines, games tables, Ninja fryers, electric bikes, dumbells,De Walt power tool sets unique artist items images stolen from Etsy and the likes, and that's just what's on my feed at the moment.Loads of fake comments from fake profiles and hacked accounts claiming they've received the items, just click on one of the profiles to see, usually the have 5 friends, or the profile picture of a woman soon turns into an Indian male as you scroll down, they're all part of the scam. More often than not the unlucky customer receives nothing at all, sometimes a pair of 99p sunglasses just so they can see a tracking number, then by the time you receive the item, the ad and the website will be gone, along with your money. The scammers will then be working on the next scam ad and website .Scammers making millions out of the gullible Facebook customers. The ads are reported but come back as the sellers are doing nothing wrong and left to continue. Facebook know very well it's going on, but the ad revenue from these crooks are what keep their shareholders happy, so it's not in their interest to clean their act up, making them just as guilty as the scam gangs themselves. My advice to anyone reading this, is don't buy anything off Facebook ads that sounds cheap, in fact I've just stopped totally which is a shame for the genuine sellers. I guarantee there's no bargains to be had on there, buy it on Amazon, pay a little more (or a lot more if its a ludicrous scam ad) and you'll get it next day, with the option to return it. Remember, when you see one of these scam ads on Facebook, you're actually putting your bank details into a scam website. Who knows who's seeing these details. You might well end up with an empty bank account.Tips1-look at the comments, go to newest first, if the seller hasn't removed the bad comments they'll be there for you to see.2-see how many angry faces there are on the thumbs bit. The seller can't remove these.3-on their actual Facebook page see how long ago it was created, it's usually only a few days old and sometimes the description of the page has no relevance to what they're selling I.e baby product services selling dodgy power tools.4 Google their website but put 'reviews' at the end of it. If there's no results then it's that new that even the scam adviser websites haven't even picked up on it yet.5-if it's an obvious scam, spam the comments with scam meme's or the likes, they'll probably get removed by the seller depending on what time you do it but it may just save one person losing their money.",2023-03-12T14:45:23.000Z,1

The platform is often cluttered and confusing, making it difficult to find the information I need or engage with my friends and family. The algorithmic timeline has become increasingly frustrating, as it often shows me irrelevant or repetitive content and seems to prioritize advertising over authentic interactions. I am also concerned about the privacy and security of my personal data, given the recent controversies around Facebook's data handling practices. While Facebook does provide a way to connect with friends and family, I am finding it increasingly difficult to justify using the platform given its many downsides.

Facebook don't seem to have any filters for these posts, so when I comment on some of these people's posts they are very angry with me which is ridiculous. What do they expect? In return I have been getting stupid warnings from Facebook saying my comments go against their standards and then they put a block on my account. I don't get it. Facebook is a platform to comment or share your experiences, yet when you do comment on something you get told off. Makes no sense to me whatsoever. ð?¤?

1040,"I have always had a sense of being manipulated by Face Book which has eventually turned into a belief. I only signed into it a few years ago owing to a extra curricular group I'm involved with making it impossible to do otherwise. Prior to that I read an article where some celebraties gave very good and valid reasons as to why they avoided all social media , until 2020 I was also in that better camp.  When I arrived on Facebook I soon had a 100  friends. In time I've found them to be less than contacts. I also noticed how face book is at war with the  personal   freedoms of inididuals and the very design of it seems to suggest it should change its name to Noose Book. Constantly sending you sensational click bait and state sponsored  propaganda  , commenting and reacting let alone offering a rational point of view is a waste of time and can often be a bare foot walk on a razor blade.  It's not obvious at fist that if you comment on an article in your own spare time that so called friends get to see the comments as Facebook streams our info around regardless of context or relevance. Hang on I play  football and have other interests and groups non of which I want to trumpet my political opinions or rational least of all set myself up for their stupid judgments.  Facebook is the equivalent of moving into a new shinny town with all the modern amenities and many for a price. Then having  to walk around and go about your daily business with a sandwich board attached to your person conveying  all of  you personal info at all times and often being directed by a Facebook cop most of the time into one bad situation after another( true there  are ways to ring fence a lot but that is never the defualt setting when  it should be ). Which is profitable to their world city  hall.      During the  Covid  crisis I took a very strong view on the deniers and corrupt behaviour  of the UK governments , not only was I shunned and labelled as a Troll by my  peer group without so much as a discussion  I was also sent charming threats by keyboard warriors and like others have said when you retaliate  to someone you got in an account warning again the Robotic and ire-rational system, seldom factors in context or balance. It's not in Facebooks interests like their ethos of  low over heads , click bait and fake news are. A certain amount of free speech  is whipped up and thrown a few scraps of meat  but then the cage is shut.  Facebook will decide how your'e comments appear or don't it actually has nothing to do with they're so called guidelines. If Facebooks want's to ensure that your comments are only visible  to the people your criticising  or Trolls with an opposing view it will do that.   As a user you have to spend a lot of time putting  up your own fences data wise as the default set up is designed to leave individuals vulnerable and exposed  , When I set up my Facebook account I was naive .   They no longer seem to ban comments or issue penalties ,now they behave in a more underhanded way , that low overheads factor at play , perhaps. Comments can be hidden , shadow banned and never seen . If that's not 198-4 enough they also have a sinister  new feature called help. Basically instead of reporting a user you can press help and that's a handy way to silence those you disagree with as their comments will be shadow banned , of the back of some virtually anon user acting  state nurse. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy against the people , allows loads of hateful comments about Refugees , women and other historically vulnerable groups , I must state however I see little in the way of anti Jewish comments being allowed to fly through even the odd stereotypical  joke but several about Muslims all being , bad people in so many different news comments.  It's clear our politicians  are silly and enjoy too much power they let unhinged narcissists  and socially stunted individuals  like Zuckerberg strut around like the inheritor of the earth , despite his only life experience being from the dorm to the boardroom. I also notice if you comment about a over population of rich Chinese students in the UK and question what that brings to British society that also gets shadow banned or driven into unfriendly traffic.   Ultimately it is  clear that Facebook cares next to nothing about the safety of people there privacy  or well being . Everything about pushing the interests of the one per cent and keeping the masses baying at each other like a bunch of deranged wolf's .          In the real world away from American and Chinese controlled social media you get to chose what to share and when to do it .

After I repeated the same simple message that I didn't get what I paid for, the furthest I got was a ""we're investigating the issue"". That was 5 days ago. It's been one week after the match and the event page still tells me to ""Get access"" for the fee, and I have not been refunded.I have seen screenshots of the same ""Sam"" CSO replying to others, but somehow Facebook's modus operandi is to pretend nothing went wrong. In one case, ""Sam"" even tried to push the support ticket to Google, somehow blaming them when the user made no use of Google's services and providing a link to Google's support channel. So far the only way people have gotten refunds is through their payment channel (PayPal, Revolut, etc), when this should have been a straightforward mass refund.

Reporting spam and scams doesn't do anything, you simply get a bot message that they didn't remove the accounts or replies because there's nothing wrong according to their garbage automated systems.. You see the same telegram scam bots everywhere lately and the usual 'Go to this person's Instagram to get your page/account back' scams, but when you report them literally nothing happens because Facebook says it's 'not against the rules'.. Are you shitting me? So you're telling me that it's totally fine for these clowns to hack your page/account and there's nothing that you're able to do because it's not against the rules? What a utter joke.2. If your account/page is hacked, Facebook will do literally nothing to help you recover it. They don't even know who you are yet they have all your data which they sell off to other websites/platforms itself such as Google.3. Apparently it's okay for pages to post 'sexual suggestive' content but when you do it on your own Facebook account, you literally get banned for 30 days because of 'sexual suggestive content' ? What a joke.4. They are doing nothing against bots (Same as YouTube) who are promoting scams on their website.5. People can say the most heinous stuff possible on Facebook and nothing will happen but when i call someone a idiot/moron, i get banned for 30 days because of 'Harassment/violence and terrorism' ?

1127,"Please stop forcing unwanted changes on users. In recent times Facebook has implemented ""Suggested for you"" which suggests similar businesses, pages, posts, etc., on Pages as well as personal feeds. As an owner of a handful of pages I was not advised that they were doing this, and found out that people viewing the pages are being shown posts for other pages/groups instead of being shown the posts for the actual page they are viewing. In one page (if not more) the suggested posts were completely unrelated as they took one word out of the page description and used it out of context as the sole basis of the ""suggestions"".Facebook's response would no doubt be something like ""but we gave you a way to opt out of the suggested posts"". Of course they are technically true - but the way to opt out involved going into each page 1 by 1 and clicking through multiple screens to get to the relevant option. When you get to the correct page, the actual option to deselect is cryptic - you are required to deselect the option to suggest your page on other pages, with a by-product of that selection being that other pages are not suggested on your page.As for suggestions appearing in your personal feed (or when logged in as a Page), tough luck. There is no option to turn it off, instead it tells you that you can hide posts you don't want to see. This doesn't help at all as it just suggests an almost identical post from  another person/page.Just let us use your site without forcing unnecessary changes that only serve to confuse and disenfranchise readers of pages.",2023-01-05T12:04:32.000Z,2

So Paypal has sent the Facebook's charge into my bank account. What's strange (bizarre) that neither Paypal nor Facebook did not invoice me for the charge and did not document it at all. I can't report it as FRAUD to my bank since the charge came via Paypal and Paypal is not cooperating well since the charge went into my bank and is undocumented by Paypal. While Facebook or Meta Platforms or Meta or whatever else name they disguise themselves under and their ads payment support  and all this maze of Facebook/Meta supports denies the charge and is asking for a reference number for that particular unauthorized undocumented uninvoiced charge while there is NO reference number under my bank account, only the following description: INST XFER ID:METAPLATFOR INDN:""MYFIRSTLASTNAMEHERE"" CO ID:PAYPALSI77 WEB Other Payment"".

Clearly they must have allegedly charged millions or billions of users for the same or similar amount just to make more money. And Facebook has already charged me for a legally INVOICED (documented and agreed upon) amount for the ad they were running for me for a limited period of 7 days (and a full stop). This is a NIGHTMARE and I have now blocked Facebook from being able to remove even more money from my Paypal and bank accounts by removing Paypal payment method from my Facebook business ads page, but now Facebook posted the following under ""Go to Account Quality"" which is located under /accountquality/ â?? ACCOUNT RESTRICTED ""We couldn't process one of your payments. Pay the amount due to run ads again."" and ""Can't run ads"" â?? not that I want to use Facebook Ads (Meta whatever) ever again though!

It means you are on point. It has nothing whatsoever to do with violence. This is not even censorship. It's simply ignorance. It is amazing that fb hires disqualified person for the job.

1184,"I've used Facebook for almost 15 years. I've had an on again off again experience and somewhat of a love-hate relationship. I know they steal my data and manipulate me in many ways but it is a good way to share what is going on in our lives with our friends and family so I have stuck with it. Last year I started posting music and videos every day. These posts are important to me and I've used them to share about our lives and to teach others. Facebook automatically creates a memories list and shows posts from prior years and this list is neglecting to include these posts. Again, these posts are very personal and important to me, and I've spent a lot of time on them. I post every single day, almost like an online video blog. It's infuriating and discouraging that Facebook is purposely leaving them off of my memories list. They're doing it on purpose because even third party apps like Time Hop can't find them. I have reported the problem a dozen times and nobody at Facebook has gotten back to me so it's obvious that not only do they know about it, they're not going to do it anything about it. Facebook is curating my posts and leaving some of my important memories off based on some algorithm or criteria.

1204,"To Whom it May Concern,My name is Candy Nutt-Melton and I am writing this because I am at my wits end trying to deal with my Facebook account. A few days before Thanksgiving I noticed posts that I did not post. I changed my password immediately. Thanksgiving Day while with family and not using Facebook a family member asked me about something I had just posted. I was not on my Facebook at the time. Yet I posted a four-bedroom house that I supposedly had for rent. I currently live in a bus. Any thoughts? The next day while chatting with a friend on messenger I received a notice that I had posted material that went against community standards. Within minutes I received a second notice that my account was locked and blocked from view. I at once began attempting to fix the issue. I had not posted anything; I was chatting with a friend. I at least wanted to see what I had apparently posted. I could not even find my account. Very upset I decided I would sleep on it and fix it the next day. It is now five days later, and I have attempted every support help fix I have found and called every number I have found. I have even uploaded a copy of my state ID to prove I am who I say I am. I did manage to see a partial view of the post and from what I could see I do fully agree that whoever posted it should have to deal with this. Not me. I continue to get a â??sent code to phone and that it could take a few minutesâ? message only no code is ever sent, if a code is requested too many times it will lock, so Iâ??m stuck waiting for a code. I requested code to change my password and I did receive code for that. I have changed my password several times over the last week. I eventually become angry and log out, and thatâ??s when I get a message telling me my account is locked and that I have so many days to request a review. I have tried to find where and how to request a review. I found a section in the help guide that asked me to upload my ID, so I did. Received the message it could take up to 24 hours for them to look at it and decide if they were wrong they will unlock my account , if they decide that I am wrong than I will be banned. I have had my account for several years and never have I had any problems. I will be more than happy to provide all my personal information. I have not been asked any questions as to did I post this? Where am I located? Nothing. I have a large number of people that would gladly verify anything about me or anything I have ever posted on Facebook. I can even provide a list of people that do not like me that would verify the same as those that do. I do think Facebook was right to block the post. Although I strongly feel that before they lock someoneâ??s account for review they should provide details of the steps the person should take to provide information that I feel should be included in that review. Much like so many others in the world Facebook is my contact with my family and friends. One difference for me is that due to my challenges with Agoraphobia at times it is my only contact with any one outside my home. Facebook has been the only contact I have had with the outside world for weeks at a time on many occasions. I am not upset that this happened. What I am upset about is the process Facebook is using. I have years of photos and Tags that people have sent me over the last several years attached to my Facebook account that will be lost if Facebook decides to delete my account. I feel like a child that is being punished for someone elseâ??s actions. I am not even given the opportunity to speak on my behalf much less defend myself. Wait that is whatâ??s happening only difference is Iâ??m an adult. Great Moral Ethics Facebook!  Horrible Parenting! There is a right way to handle things. Then there seems to be the Facebook way.

Yesterday (17/11/22,  I had a lot of issues with bullying on the Ritchie Sunak Group.  This group to be honest has a majority of Indian followers and hardly any from the UK. Yesterday I was subject to bullying, hate speech, and racism.  I reported it to Facebook because one person said a dreadful thing about mutilation to me and then he removed it as it was so awful.  I reported it to Facebook and they send a standard response saying this does not go outside of our regulations!!  In addition on Remembrance Weekend, there were the most disrespectful and awful comments about our war heroes.  Again I reported and nothing, just it's within our rules so perhaps these people have no idea how people sacrificed their lives for us.  This week I shared a post regarding our war veterans and what they mean to the world but the group would not approve it!  I complained again but nothing.  You could even say that as this group only exists to worship Ritchi Sunak, they don't want to know the truth.  The group is also full of begging posts asking us for money and they think Rishi is Indian but he was born in the UK!  This can't continue to section out British people and individuals posting hate speech.  Yesterday I got called Ugly, and fat, my dogs look better than me plus racist comments towards white people.  Facebook Admin doesn't listen and act on issues!  Sadly I have to continue to use it and don't like Instagram so I have no choice.",2022-11-18T11:49:43.000Z,1

I have spent the last couple of days reinstalling the files on the new hard drive as well as reinstating accounts where passwords have been lost.  Every other organisation has sent codes to reset passwords, but not Facebook. My profile photograph, e-mail and telephone number is displayed but despite asking on numerous occasions for codes to be sent none have arrived.  I run a Facebook Page for a local non-profit making marine conservation area that Facebook treats as a business.  Every time I post on the Page, Facebook tries to sell advertising saying that if I pay Â£14 the post will be boosted to reach more people, but I doubt what they say.  How can you possibly trust Facebook with this, or anything else, if they canâ??t even send codes to recover an account?  Anyone who tries to run a business solely on Facebook is misguided to say the least.    One might argue that using Facebook is free, but it isnâ??t, as in return for using it they have access to your personal details and show you advertisements.

I finally opened a new account under Steven Tessier My old account is under Steve Tessier. With Facebook you can send them your Driverâ??s License to change the password but the old cell number still gets the codes to retrieve the old Facebook account. So you can set up a new password but they send you a code to your old cell that you canâ??t retrieve. There is no way you can talk to a live agent.

Personally I think those buttons are NOT proprietary. Thumbs up/down have been used since Roman times. Iâ??ve seen thumbs up/down on other websites. I am not a lawyer but I think trademarking an icon as facebook did is not the same to me as having buttons on a remote in someone's home or trademarking a distinctive app icon to represent a company. I believe NO ONE should have proprietary rights over thumbs up/down. How can they bully tivo into deactivating those buttons? I think facebook should get over itself.

Everyone has a Constitutional Right to express their opinions without any consequences which Facebook Seriously Ignores.  Just because someone is extremely wealthy does NOT give them the ability to pick and choose which Rights anyone can exercise and that is Precisely what Facebook is engaging in!!!

1616,"Had the most fantastic ski trip with my family. It was our first time away skiing and we were a little anxious about travelling during the pandemic. However, Martina and Mark ensured we had all the correct paperwork and insurances in line to help us travel with ease. The accommodation was a real hit. Both comfortable and stylish. With a very cool leisure area down below called the â??Rave Caveâ?? we had plenty to enjoy at night with games and an extensive selection of DVDâ??s. The food selection and menu planning was diverse and delicious. With a 10 and 14 year old we were unsure we would find something that we all agreed on but we had plenty to delight us and Mark and Martina cooked it beautifully. We were meant to have one night in, but the food was so delicious we decided to stay home. Mark and Martina were wonderful hosts and very generous with their time, help and advice ensuring we had our excursions booked and in place. A truly wonderful holiday and we will absolutely return.

1619,"Facebook is the world record of â??The biggest violation of people privacy, liberty and the worst experience everâ?.Basically I only use Facebook because most mobile games use this to sync data between different devices or to create accounts, and I find it ridiculous. And the following must change without questioning.First, itâ??s almost impossible to create an account. You have about an 1/10 chance to success without extra verification, and â??disagreeingâ? that we didnâ??t â??violate their Community Standardsâ?, while we did absolutely NOTHING wrong, but just trying to create an account. And those extra steps include a PHOTO of our FACE, which some employees will see and use to verify the account, which is unacceptable. This kind of steps must be removed.Second, the primary location, which is not possible to change. And donâ??t think this is only visible to you. Anyone there working on Facebook can see that like all your stored data on your account. And the fact that this location is impossible to change makes the user experience worse, by providing location-based feeds that donâ??t interest them, because this is not what they want to see, or itâ??s not in a language they understand. Living in a country doesnâ??t mean they can speak *that* language. Two settings must be added: one to change the primary location, the second to use a chosen primary language or country for personal feeds (including ""people you may know"") instead of something location-based.Third, there are tons of useless settings and texts, a lot could be grouped together or just removed, because we are all lost in there and we donâ??t have time to always check everything. This should really be reviewed.Last, I am often hearing about censoring there in other reviews.

Craig stands behind what he sells and takes the time to explain how to derive maximum benefit (care, etc) for the products he sells.Yes, you can go to a big box store and probably purchase something cheaper.

1662,"As both a business owner and user of Facebook, it is my belief that they care not of decency and basic humanity. I'm not even making this up, they literally reward people who stay on the platform for hours on end, and punish those who do not. So if you happen to have a life where you can't be glued to their platform for hours on end, you're probably experiencing a decline in your reach and engagement on your posts these days. On the opposite end, if you're the type who spends hours on Facebook posting every meal, every life event, and gets lost in Stories, and memes, etc, then it's likely you love Facebook because you're not experiencing the same penalties as those who don't or can't spend that kind of time on the platform. Their extraordinarily strict policies and plethora of algorithms are destroying businesses by the handful. Those who aren't in this category are oblivious to this fact. It's unfortunate that SO many fellow business owners, to include myself, are being restricted and blocked from running Ads, and worse, simply because of errors in their algorithms. My account was restricted for over 6-months (I couldn't run a single Ad), and after multiple requests for review I finally received an email response saying my account was restricted in error and has been restored and ""sorry for the inconvenience"". However, by that time my business was already severely impacted and my Ads never performed the same again (likely because of one or more algorithms perpetually attached to my profile). I found out (from a ""Facebook Ad Expert"") the lack of performance is likely because all my customers and clients and potential leads who were attached to my pixel had fallen off because of the extended time. So I basically had to start from scratch to build that pixel back up. Similarly, my personal account remains restricted because it was never resolved and I was told, also via email (because that's the only support available) there was nothing they could do. All it would take to resolve this issue would be to speak with an ACTUAL PERSON. Since that's not an option with Facebook anymore, unless you happen to be among the elite, an 8-figure or more business owner, honest business owners like myself have to suffer. I'm currently shifting my business model to operate without Facebook, and unless someone with a higher moral conscience than ""Z"" and his fellow billionaire and millionaire executives takes over, I'm done. Let's really think about this for a second: As of the date of this post, Facebook has a total of 11,171 reviews on Trustpilotâ?¢. Of those reviews, only 14% of them are 5 stars and 68% of them are 1 star (2, 3, and 4 stars are 5%, 6%, and 7%, respectively). That speaks volumes! Sure, I'll check the little box at the bottom of this text box that says ""Let Facebook know about your review..."" My guess is that I won't ever hear from anyone to discuss resolution and my Facebook accounts will likely be completely shut down in retaliation. Then I'll have to post another 1 star.Prove me wrong Facebook, and I'll change/update my rating. Otherwise, it's only a matter of time before karma bites you in the booty.",2022-05-30T02:22:56.000Z,1

We have appealed this 2 months on they have done  nothing to review it. I was getting 80% referrals on Facebook then 70% on Instagram. Since blocking my personal account I can't control adverts (they still take ad money you can't see what your paying for) pixel for referrals and this is now disconnected from my website. Shopify disconnected it for safety as I can no longer use my FB account. Due to this I'm going to be looking at taking legal action against meta for loss or earnings. Because of their madeup policy I've lost loads of potential orders. They also can't come up with a proper reason for anyone why your blocked. My friend was blocked 2 times and the second was for the reason of the first blocking.  I've now moved over to tictok it's much better and much more user friendly. Without any wokebookers on the apps. My stop has already got me sales on tictok. I shall never recommend anything meta Facebook are involved in to anyone.

1695,"I am not setting Facebook down because as far as I am concern,  what you get free as a consumer you can take or leave.   So I give them still a medium critic. However, I hope someone from the company is overlooking critics and perhaps it will help to solve some of the now arriving  problems. Since Facebook has taken over other social media the advertising appears to be getting out of hand.  OK,  again, if you get something for free, someone has to pay for it.  In cases like Facebook and a few other social media the free page is produced through advertising.  Here is what is critical if it comes to advertising that actually is ruining the freedom of my so called profile wall.  When I   go shopping I don't have to enter stores I don't want.  If I get commercial at home, I can shut them down.  Facebook  has an option to remove the advertising you don't like.  But for every removal, Facebook will give you 2 fresh once  back to clutter my news feed.  Before, I was  able to choose my own subjects.  Now, they just put them in my news feed even if I  have just turned one of the same type off.   Facebook, please return to your old ways and let us choose what we like to see.  Don't push garbage and spam on your members.  Privacy law in groups or on your profile gets violated by Facebook more than enough right now.  Yes, Facebook violates our rights  to freedom of speech. (clean speech)  I host a few genealogy groups and lately,  when ever I post something that includes War, American Soldiers and historical facts,  Facebook removes it with the announcement of violation of the Facebook standart.   I had to  go after them in a few cases,  because I am very careful what I post and I don't post against their standard because I post with common sense.     Facebook, it is time to learn your history before you act out of control. Last thing on my critic list is the fact that I get posts from friends that use   pre-written posters from people or  companies that should not be able to post at all.   I grew up in a home without foul language.   Or as we called it ""Street language.""  I feel that everybody can do what they want to do.  However, when I open up my facebook in the morning and find already posters with a head line that goes deep into street language,  I feel that I don't even want to be on Facebook anymore.  if I don't want to see it I need to turn it off and in many ways I am not sure why people are allowed to post this in the first place since many Post have the type of language that is supposed to be against Facebook's policy. The title often alone is in violation of Facebook's standard,  but people still post it because they think some of the stuff is cool.  I have to admit,  that not everything is what the title says.   But often the title comes across as disrespect toward your friends.  Here, censorship of speech should be used.  Facebook, watch what you let into your door with ready made posters.   I would not be a Facebook user anymore if I wouldn't have committed myself to help others with their genealogy and  to keep in contact with family members.   However, I keep my promises even if I feel offended almost every day.  It is getting  harder to be helpful with so much uncensored filth that is coming up on Facebook now. Facebook, would  you please take care of that?  Thank you.",2022-05-19T19:23:03.000Z,3

I sent them my ID and they still didn't unlock my account.Made a second account with my real name (just like the first one) and didn't had major problems until in 2019 - 2020 when they decided to lock some of my account facilities like commenting, liking posts not only once but many, many times just because apparently some of the comments I write way back doesn't conform to their ""community standards"" saying that I harrassed or intimidate people when all I did was, for example to just say that someone was ugly. Sure, it's not a nice thing to say but I hardly doubt that this can be considered as ""harassment and intimidation"".And using this excuse they crippled my account many times.Also they have no support, no contact e-mail, no phone, no live chat, no web form, nothing that resembles any kind of support.If your account is ""temporarily locked"" and you can't login in your account, if functionality of your account is suspended for a month, if your account gets hacked there's absolutely no way to contact support if their support even exists in the first place.If you have a Facebook account please mark it for deletion and stop using it all together.There's absolutely no point in using such unreliable social media.",2022-05-19T17:04:39.000Z,1

I woke up one day and got a popup asking me to verify my phone number, so I did and enter a code they sent me then BAM, my account was locked out and they told me to wait 24 hours.First, let me start by saying I NEVER had issues with Facebook or Instagram. Theyâ??re collecting data and learning from me as a cost for me using their platform and Iâ??ve accept that. I accepted their changes, their consistent pushy ads, their bugs, glitches, and everything else. But this is going TOO FAR. Iâ??ve read on so many places online, app reviews, Reddit posts where many people have also gotten their Instagram or Facebook account suspended for no reason.Keep in mind, Iâ??m a very average user who shares my creative content (nothing with violence, nudity, or anything offensive). Iâ??m the most average Instagram user that uses the platform to keep up with artists, following many awesome pages and to have group conversations with friends and family.Secondly, this is atrociously irresponsible of Meta/IG/FB to suspend accounts just because they programmed some bot that mistakenly flags people for innocent things or for no reason at all (in my case). They disable accounts instantly with no warning but yet with all the data they collected, all the money they make from ad spend, marketing and transactions, they canâ??t have at least ONE call center with humans to look through these cases and reactivate accounts which takes probably a click of a button?!?!! They literally donâ??t care about their user-base or community whether you pay them or not hence why customer support is a foreign concept to them!Thirdly, Iâ??ve tried submitting numerous forms for weeks. Iâ??ve submitted humiliating photos of myself holding up a handwritten sign per their instructions at least 7 times and submitted my ID to them 3 times only to be ignored over and over again.Iâ??m flipping infuriated right now and Iâ??ve heard this happen to people in the past. I never thought it would happen to me but since it happened, Iâ??ve been nothing but angry. I feel like a portion of my social life has been robbed from me. Many people reading this might think thatâ??s over exaggeration but Iâ??m in my early 30s, Iâ??m introverted and I have a lot of mental burden Iâ??m dealing with. Sharing and posting on IG and connecting with other artists around the world was my way to cope. Iâ??ve lost it all in a blink of an eye! I cannot create a new account because I don't have a separate phone number or email that i could use since my contact details are still connected to the disabled account. Also, making a new account and trying to regain all my data from the past 12 years manually is just too much work!FYI: There's scammers and spammers everywhere on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media with people claiming they could hack and get your account back. These jerks are spamming this everywhere, trying to mislead people into thinking they can retrieve accounts. Then, there's others who ""know people at IG"" and try to charge thousands for getting accounts reactivated for you. IG claims they don't allow this but if they can't even help us, why would they care about their employees extorting users?! I cannot believe this has been an on-going problem for so long and IG just brushed it away.

The methods are overly complicated/difficult to manage and the ads manager is the most overblown, inutile system I have ever come across, focusing on all the wrong things and offering nothing that is genuinely useful - BUT - the advertising 'does' actually work. The problem is, due to the aforementioned problems, the system starts off adverts without authorisation, it duplicates adverts and it charges both daily and monthly, once a limit is reached, but at the same time, it is almost impossible to review the adverts and trace the problem. One wrong move, one keystroke - and you have started an advert off, which can be difficult to stop. Worse than that, when you eventually manage to navigate the rats maze that is the procedure for communicating with this communications company, they absolutely refuse to admit error. Fighting to win back refunds for overcharging is SO time consuming that it negates the benefit of advertising at all. This service is terrible and its failings far outweigh the gain.

Destabilizing political regimes as well as spreading dangerous disinformation. Facebook has stood above laws and regulations for too long. It destroys the very integrity of our worlds fabric. Facebook NEEDs to be shut down, it needs to held accountable to anti monopoly laws. The sale and acquisition of both instagram and whatsapp were completely unjustified. Especially considering as they both function as social media platforms. Whatsapp alows stories nowadays and Instagram is essentially identical to facebook since facebook has decided to story features as well as ""reels"". Facebook is completely corrupt, it disregards their users by distributing their data for profit. they allow third party applications to manipulate facebook at basically zero consequence. Putting user identifications, names, personal data as well as credit information widely public for every body. Facebook cares very little about the data that is leaked from facebook because it sells that data to basically nyone anyways. Heard of cainbridge analytica? Facebook is literally responsible for the political destabilization in both great nations and minor nations. Facebook is a virus that we willingly download on to our own computers and phones. It listens to our conversations, it takes pictures of us when ever it pleases. It is the AI that is going to destroy us like in the movie terminator. I'm quite literally at risk writing this.

1969,"Facebook have gone overboard with their so called Community Standards..... I made a comment on a news post about an old punishment that involved cutting hands off thieves....The thieves desecrated graves and stole a head from 2 different cemeteries... Facebook restricted my account saying it went against their ""Community Standards""  Wow!! Not allowed to use history in your opinions these days? What rock are these monitors of comments and posts stuck under? They allow sick posts on there such as a video of a woman straddling over a large dog and grinding herself on its back bone.... I reported it as sexual content involving animals and they refused to remove it because they said it doesn't go against their standards??? Seriously?? They put Ads on everything now and is annoying when you can't skip them all the time, some you can.... They still allow scammers to post and accounts are still stolen..... Facebook is becoming a site for people that like to keep their head in the sand and have no freedom of speech.... Many people that I know have left Facebook because of similar reasons....I'm starting to consider it myself.... It's not enjoyable anymore and way too strict",2022-02-03T23:19:37.000Z,1

1980,Facebook has become  more and more of a government site to track everything that people are saying and doing. There are banning anyone that puts up anything they don't want people to see on this site . It's very obvious to me that they want authoritarian people on here that want to be controlled.  It's a shame that anyone like facebook should have so much control over what people's opinions  are.  It's time for facebook to be deleted  from the internet .I hope that it goes down in my time .people have opinions  and not everyone supported  every person's opinions.  But it's not up to facebook to make that choice . There not God. People should be able to say what ever they want .,2022-01-30T16:26:53.000Z,1

They don't like Christians of the paler skinned kind, and if they had their way we would all be burned to the stake by that CGI looking overlord, Suckerberk.",2022-01-29T00:51:56.000Z,1
1985,"Two days' ban from the Facebook police because I said an evil person should be hung by their own entrails for injuring a horse so badly, she lost both eyes! Thankfully, the beautiful girl has found a loving, forever home, which I also mentioned. What is wrong with these people? So much for free speech! Honestly, you see far, FAR worse posted, but it seems to be acceptable. What does it say about their staff?",2022-01-28T14:16:11.000Z,1
1986,"It used to be a good site ten years ago but nowadays it's truly dreadful and I hope one day it closes down. You get banned for saying things which don't actually violate any Facebook rules and bullying is allowed a lot of the time. One woman told me to get Cancer and die and I reported her and Facebook said it was perfectly acceptable what she said. I called her disgusting and Facebook banned me and actually deleted my account completely. Bullying on Facebook is a truly staggering problem, plus now you can't actually get through to any customer service staff you can only leave site feedback so Facebook don't want to know if you need any help. Even if you click on the help function it actually does nothing more than leave feedback. People can report you for disagreeing with them too and Facebook can ban you for bullying for simply disagreeing. I was banned earlier this year for saying ""sorry I don't agree with that"", the woman became furious that I disagreed and reported me and Facebook banned me. I'd say Facebook isn't a site anyone should use nowadays and society needs to go back to how it was before the internet, advertise for friendss or love in the newspapers or in chip shops. Real life meet up groups, get each other other's phone numbers and be real friends not virtual friends. Depression, obesity, suicides etc...all higher now than before social networkign and social media was created, why? Because there used to be real life social meet groups and people used to go out meeting new people and that  helped. Now people sit at home doing nothing and feel lonely and the suicide rate has doubled. Facebook has damaged society and that's been proven too by doctors and psychiatrists.",2022-01-28T10:18:12.000Z,1
